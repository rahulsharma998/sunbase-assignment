Project Structure
```bash
form-builder/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file containing the structure of the page
├── index.css         # Styling for the form builder and form fields
├── index.js          # JavaScript for adding, deleting, and managing form fields
└── README.md         # This README file
```
index.html
The HTML file contains the layout and structure for the form builder interface. It includes buttons for adding form fields, a main container to display the form, and an area for dragging and dropping fields.

index.css
The CSS file contains all the styles for the form builder interface. It is responsible for the layout of the sidebar, form fields, and buttons, along with hover and active states for interactive elements.

index.js
The JavaScript file handles the interactivity of the form builder, including the drag-and-drop functionality, field addition, field deletion, and saving the form data. It also defines the fields available to the user (e.g., input, select, textarea, checkbox).

Example Output
Once you've added fields to the form and clicked the Save button, the following data will be logged to the console:

[
    {
        "id": "c0ac49c5-871e-4c72-a878-251de465e6b4",
        "type": "input",
        "label": "Sample Input",
        "placeholder": "Sample placeholder"
    },
    {
        "id": "146e69c2-1630-4a27-9d0b-f09e463a66e4",
        "type": "select",
